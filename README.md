Fast Markov chain data mining.

##Introduction

A Markov chain can be represented in matrix form where each input column is linked to an output row.
The entries in the matrix are real number between 0 and 1 giving the probability of change.

Markov chains are specially useful when you want to make games that change content dynamically.
By learning from examples, the Markov chain can generate random data that "look like" the original.

Markov chains are also useful as analytic tool and to navigate large data sets.
